## Notes

### Old Benoni occupy dark squares, trading away light square bishop is normal because it's so terrible

### Superfluous knights, f6 d7 taking away each other squares, Nf6-e8 opens up the dark square bishop

### Benko gambit different from most pawn gambits, more of a positional advantage rather than short term tactical

### Nd7 instead of Ng6, I already know that the bishop wants to go to g7, so don't block g6

### Defensive tactic after Nxe5 Qh5+
