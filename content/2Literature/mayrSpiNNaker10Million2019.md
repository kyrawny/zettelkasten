# [SpiNNaker 2: A 10 Million Core Processor System for Brain Simulation and Machine Learning](zotero://select/items/@mayrSpiNNaker10Million2019)

SpiNNaker is an ARM-based processor platform optimized for the simulation of spiking neural networks. This brief describes the roadmap in going from the current SPINNaker1 system, a 1 Million core machine in 130nm CMOS, to SpiNNaker2, a 10 Million core machine in 22nm FDSOI. Apart from pure scaling, we will take advantage of specific technology features, such as runtime adaptive body biasing, to deliver cutting-edge power consumption. Power management of the cores allows a wide range of workload adaptivity, i.e. processor power scales with the complexity and activity of the spiking network. Additional numerical accelerators will enhance the utility of SpiNNaker2 for simulation of spiking neural networks as well as for executing conventional deep neural networks. These measures should increase the simulation capacity of the machine by a factor $>$50. The interplay between the two domains, i.e. spiking and rate based, will provide an interesting field for algorithm exploration on SpiNNaker2. Apart from the platforms' traditional usage as a neuroscience exploration tool, the extended functionality opens up new application areas such as automotive AI, tactile internet, industry 4.0 and biomedical processing.
