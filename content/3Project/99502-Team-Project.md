# Project - 99502 Team Project

Students in a group of 2 will produce two simulation models to demonstrate the application of brain-inspired computing. Students will work on a project and research on 1) a topic covered in lectures and 2) a topic not covered in lectures. Student should compare the characteristics of the models if possible. Student should produce a model for each topic.
