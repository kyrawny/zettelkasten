    * Definition of the opening depends on the strength of the player
      * For below IM level, knowing up to move 10-15 is enough, but to reach IM the opening starts after move 15. Depth grows as you progress
    * How you study the opening also depends on the strength of the player
      * Below IM, openings are not really about memorization, but rather the general ideas
    * Each opening has a specific character, choose the one that fits your personality and the one that you like playing
    * Stalk role models who play the openings you do
      * Add all their games to a database
    * Overview of e4
      * More direct way of controlling the center with both e4 and d4, d4 is responded more often with moves that prevent e4
      * e4 e5
        * Has a very simple idea, White wants to target the weak f7 pawn
          * Opera game is a good example, and how the Philidor defense is poor, the best version is the Hanham variation because it removes a lot of the tricks
          * Bc4 instead of Nc3, knight on c3 is often a bad piece in e4 e5 games because the main idea is to play c3 d4, Bc4 controls light squares and Black has no response
        * Nf3 Nc6 is the best response, but Black doesn't really want the knight to be on c6
          * In both the Spanish and the Italian, White wants to play c3 and d4, the entire opening centers around this struggle
          * Italian: e4 e5 Nf3 Nc6 Bc4 Bc5 c3 Nf6 d3 d6 Nd2 then white continues h3 Nf1 Ng3 O-O 
          * Spanish: c3 h3 move order important, depends on when Black plays d5, if you play h3 too early Black can play Na5 to trade away the knight for the bishop to get the bishop pair. Showcases how move order is based off your understanding of what each move does
          * Evan's: you must be objective when you choose more speculative positions like this, when you play the most fundamental, principled lines you will always end up with an at least OK position
      * e4 c5
        * Nf3 because White wants to play d4
        * Sicilian is very rich, every separate line has completely different ideas, unlike the Spanish and the Italian
          * Choose your lines from a practical standpoint: make sure it's far easier for your opponents to go wrong, instead of you
          * Alapin is a good line at the more novice level
            * Alexander Khalifmann c3 Sicilian
          * Grand prix
            * www.chessmood.com
          * Open Sicilian
            * Max Illingworth Dismantling the Sicilian
    * Overview of d4
      * Queen's Gambit Declined d4 d5 c4 e6 Nc3
        * Magnus Carlsen - Vladimir Kramnik, black has problem developing LSB
          * Everytime Black develops the LSB to Bf5, White can play e3 or Qb3
            * Never play ...b6 in response to ...Bf5 Qb3, need to support the c6 pawn, ...Qb6 is bad too because you get double isolated pawns
            * Can play ...h6 first, then Bh4, now ...Bf5 Qb3 is good for Black
              * Black can respond with g5 because after queen takes the rook, Qb6 and White's queen is out of the game
              * If you have a solution to Qb3, play ...Bf5
          * Nimzo-indian hardly every get it, but you can force White to play Nf3 first then you play ...d5, resulting in a QGD where White has not played Bg5, which prevents your LSB from developing easy
        * Minority attack
          * Carlsbad pawn structure, b4 b5, can happen in reverse in the Caro Kann with Rb8 b5 b4
      * Catalan
        * Boris Avrukh Grandmaster Repertoire, very challenging opening
    * How to read books effectively?
      * Play more blitz games, and then analyze the games, to learn how to play an opening
    * Don't use engine to learn an opening!
      * Doesn't teach you how to play outside of the top engine line, no ideas are thought. What does +0.5 mean?
      * For example in the Grunfeld, after d5 computer gives White +1.0, but Black can play more easily with Nd6 blockading the pawn, f5 a6 b5. Engine gives +1.0 because it gives a lot of values to protected passed pawns, even when all the attacking chances are for Black
      * Can you play like an engine? If you're +1.5 but only have one accurate move, then that's not a +1.5 line for you
