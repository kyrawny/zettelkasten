## Journal

Today's lunch was really nice. Ipoh Hor Fun, definitely should eat with Tea when she's back. #food I had a really fun time today with chess friends as well. They came relatively early because Jason lives very far away. I managed to score another win against Yogesh (to be fair, he was very tired). We talked a lot of shit about army and SCDF, and had zichar for dinner (prawn paste chicken, sambal kang kong, minced pork with salted fish).
