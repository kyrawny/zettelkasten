## Meetings

* [x] Meetings:
  * [x] Meeting 20210804 SCF Affiliate
    * Attendees: Kyra, Lau
    * Decide if we will go ahead with the vote on Sunday
      * @Lau thinks that we should not go ahead
        * Problem is continuation of practice of paying for the affiliate fee and address, after change of exco
        * Asking Kevin is imposing too much
      * Only reason to go ahead early is to try to get a vote in for the AGM
      * Long-term possible plans:
        * Becoming direct subgroup under SCF
        * Becoming subgroup of some entity, e.g. CC
        * Change in SCF exco might mean change in long-term plans
    * Upcoming meeting will be used to vote on the proposed inter-varsity tour
