## Meetings

* [x] Meetings:
  * [x] SiVCA board meeting 2000
  * [x] Aarti ACTVision meeting 2100
    * Aarti had originally proposed a video version of ACTVision to Prof Jesse Hoey, publishing to Frontiers in Sept
      * Context classifier: Places 2
      * Identities classifier:
    * Plausible idea: reverse and use incoherence/deflection to determine the most likely combination from the top 5 results from each model
      * Defeats the purpose of using the model to analyze scenes with high deflection
    * Currently: can detect bounding box of two people and slowfast model actions
      * Cut out bounding boxes of people and send to identities model, might reduce effectiveness due to lack of context, could present both models as alternatives in the paper
      * VideoIntelligence Google
      * Synsets
    * *20210824* 1100 (20210823 2300 Toronto time), Meet up again to touch base and continue work from there
      * Things to focus on up to then: 2 person Action classifier
        * Moviegraphs
        * ==See if I can use Annusha's LIReC code and run it locally, use to show both identities & interactions, while using Places 2 for context==
          * Important thing is to show the plausibility of using BayesACT
          * Can compare against Google Vision API possibly
