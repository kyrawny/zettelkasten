202108092218 SNNs use less arithmetic operations for certain sparse coding optimization problems Sparse coding refers to unsupervised methods of learning how to represent data efficiently using a linear combination of a relatively small number of elements from a feature dictionary. One such method is the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), which finds an estimate of the representation by minimizing the least square error subject to a ℓ1-norm constraint in the solution vector.</description></item><item><title>202108041944 SNNs utilize spatiotemporal data, unlike DNNs</title><link>https://kyrawny.github.io/1Permanent/202108041944-SNNs-utilize-spatiotemporal-data-unlike-DNNs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 1970 22:06:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kyrawny.github.io/1Permanent/202108041944-SNNs-utilize-spatiotemporal-data-unlike-DNNs/</guid><description>Contexts Neuromorphic Computing | Spiking Neural Networks | Artificial Intelligence | Machine Learning
202108041944 SNNs utilize spatiotemporal data, unlike DNNs SNNs incorporate the concept of time and space in their operating model. Unlike DNNs, where every neuron sends a continuous output at every time cycle to every neuron in the next layer, neurons in SNNs only transmit single-bit impulses (or spikes) to neighbors through directed connections known as synapses, when a membrane potential reaches a certain threshold.</description></item><item><title>202107291348 Multiply accumulate arrays efficiently perform matrix multiplications in DNNs</title><link>https://kyrawny.github.io/1Permanent/202107291348-Multiply-accumulate-arrays-efficiently-perform-matrix-multiplications-in-DNNs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 1970 22:05:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kyrawny.github.io/1Permanent/202107291348-Multiply-accumulate-arrays-efficiently-perform-matrix-multiplications-in-DNNs/</guid><description>Contexts Deep Neural Networks | Computing Hardware | Artificial Intelligence | Machine Learning
202107291348 Multiply accumulate arrays efficiently perform matrix multiplications in DNNs Every connection between neurons in a deep neural network is assigned a weight. Inputs to the deep neural network are multiplied by these weights. Thus, in the forward pass of a deep neural network, much of the computation done consists of vector matrix multiplications. In computing, these calculations are achieved through the accumulation of products, via multiply-accumulate operations.</description></item><item><title>202107291603 MAC arrays, a tool for DNNs, can be used to supplement the performance of SNNs with high-dimensional inputs, while maintaining system flexibility</title><link>https://kyrawny.github.io/1Permanent/202107291603-MAC-arrays-a-tool-for-DNNs-can-be-used-to-supplement-the-performance-of-SNNs-with-high-dimensional-inputs-while-maintaining-system-flexibility/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 1970 22:05:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kyrawny.github.io/1Permanent/202107291603-MAC-arrays-a-tool-for-DNNs-can-be-used-to-supplement-the-performance-of-SNNs-with-high-dimensional-inputs-while-maintaining-system-flexibility/</guid><description>Contexts Neuromorphic Computing | Computing Hardware | Deep Neural Networks | Spiking Neural Networks | Artificial Intelligence | Machine Learning
202107291603 MAC arrays, a tool for DNNs, can be used to supplement the performance of SNNs with high-dimensional inputs, while maintaining system flexibility Neuromorphic hardware platforms like Loihi have dedicated circuits for synapses and neurons to increase the efficiency of spiking neural network models implemented on them. However, this results in less flexible systems that cannot be used to implement more diverse models, that additionally do not have specialized tools to handle specific types of computations.</description></item><item><title>20210724 - KyraWNY 0 vs whylikethat 1 - Sq1IQ7zD</title><link>https://kyrawny.github.io/2Literature/20210724-KyraWNY-0-vs-whylikethat-1-Sq1IQ7zD/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kyrawny.github.io/2Literature/20210724-KyraWNY-0-vs-whylikethat-1-Sq1IQ7zD/</guid><description>Contexts 0Context/Chess | ECO A18 English Opening - Mikenas-Carls Variation | A10-A39 English opening

Closed-Loop Neuromorphic Benchmarks Evaluating the effectiveness and performance of neuromorphic hardware is difficult. It is even more difficult when the task of interest is a closed-loop task; that is, a task where the output from the neuromorphic hardware affects some environment, which then in turn affects the hardware’s future input. However, closed-loop situations are one of the primary potential uses of neuromorphic hardware. To address this, we present a methodology for generating closed-loop benchmarks that makes use of a hybrid of real physical embodiment and a type of “minimal” simulation.</description></item><item><title>Comparing Loihi with a SpiNNaker 2 Prototype on Low-Latency Keyword Spotting and Adaptive Robotic Control</title><link>https://kyrawny.github.io/2Literature/yanComparingLoihiSpiNNaker2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kyrawny.github.io/2Literature/yanComparingLoihiSpiNNaker2021/</guid><description>Contexts Neuromorphic Computing | Speech Processing | Robotic Control | Deep Neural Networks | Spiking Neural Networks | Artificial Intelligence | Machine Learning | Computing Hardware

Fast and energy-efficient neuromorphic deep learning with first-spike times For a biological agent operating under environmental pressure, energy consumption and reaction times are of critical importance. Similarly, engineered systems are optimized for short time-to-solution and low energy-to-solution characteristics. At the level of neuronal implementation, this implies achieving the desired results with as few and as early spikes as possible. With time-to-first-spike coding both of these goals are inherently emerging features of learning.</description></item><item><title>Fleeting Notes</title><link>https://kyrawny.github.io/Fleeting-Notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kyrawny.github.io/Fleeting-Notes/</guid><description>Zettelkasten is supposed to lower barriers to entry, not create more.

GPUs Outperform Current HPC and Neuromorphic Solutions in Terms of Speed and Energy When Simulating a Highly-Connected Cortical Model While neuromorphic systems may be the ultimate platform for deploying spiking neural networks (SNNs), their distributed nature and optimisation for specific types of models makes them unwieldy tools for developing them. Instead, SNN models tend to be developed and simulated on computers or clusters of computers with standard Von Neumann CPU architectures.</description></item><item><title>Loihi: A Neuromorphic Manycore Processor with On-Chip Learning</title><link>https://kyrawny.github.io/2Literature/daviesLoihiNeuromorphicManycore2018/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kyrawny.github.io/2Literature/daviesLoihiNeuromorphicManycore2018/</guid><description>Contexts Spiking Neural Networks | Neuromorphic Computing | Artificial Intelligence | Machine Learning | Computing Hardware | Computing Methodologies

Nengo: A Python tool for building large-scale functional brain models Neuroscience currently lacks a comprehensive theory of how cognitive processes can be implemented in a biological substrate. The Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) proposes one such theory, but has not yet gathered significant empirical support, partly due to the technical challenge of building and simulating large-scale models with the NEF.</description></item><item><title>NengoDL: Combining deep learning and neuromorphic modelling methods</title><link>https://kyrawny.github.io/2Literature/rasmussenNengoDLCombiningDeep2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kyrawny.github.io/2Literature/rasmussenNengoDLCombiningDeep2019/</guid><description>Contexts [[]]

Towards spike-based machine intelligence with neuromorphic computing Guided by brain-like ‘spiking’ computational frameworks, neuromorphic computing—brain-inspired computing for machine intelligence—promises to realize artificial intelligence while reducing the energy requirements of computing platforms. This interdisciplinary field began with the implementation of silicon circuits for biological neural routines, but has evolved to encompass the hardware implementation of algorithms with spike-based encoding and event-driven representations. Here we provide an overview of the developments in neuromorphic computing for both algorithms and hardware and highlight the fundamentals of learning and hardware frameworks.</description></item></channel></rss>
