202107291348 Multiply-accumulate arrays efficiently perform matrix multiplications in DNNs Every connection between neurons in a deep neural network is assigned a weight. Inputs to the deep neural network are multiplied by these weights. Thus, in the forward pass of a deep neural network, much of the computation done consists of vector matrix multiplications. In computing, these calculations are achieved through the accumulation of products, via multiply-accumulate operations.</description></item><item><title>202107291603 MAC arrays, a tool for DNNs, can be used to supplement the performance of SNNs with high-dimensional inputs, while maintaining system flexibility</title><link>https://kyrawny.github.io/1.-Permanent-Notes/202107291603-MAC-arrays-a-tool-for-DNNs-can-be-used-to-supplement-the-performance-of-SNNs-with-high-dimensional-inputs-while-maintaining-system-flexibility/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 1970 22:05:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kyrawny.github.io/1.-Permanent-Notes/202107291603-MAC-arrays-a-tool-for-DNNs-can-be-used-to-supplement-the-performance-of-SNNs-with-high-dimensional-inputs-while-maintaining-system-flexibility/</guid><description>Contexts Neuromorphic Computing | Computing Hardware | Deep Neural Networks | Spiking Neural Networks | Artificial Intelligence | Machine Learning
202107291603 MAC arrays, a tool for DNNs, can be used to supplement the performance of SNNs with high-dimensional inputs, while maintaining system flexibility Neuromorphic hardware platforms like Loihi have dedicated circuits for synapses and neurons to increase the efficiency of spiking neural network models implemented on them. However, this results in less flexible systems that cannot be used to implement more diverse models, that additionally do not have specialized tools to handle specific types of computations.</description></item></channel></rss>
